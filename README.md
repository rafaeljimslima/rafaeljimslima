## About me

- Senior full-stack engineer with 8+ years owning products from idea → design → API → UI → production.
- I’m comfortable across **React/Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js**, and relational databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
- I’ve shipped dashboards, AI-assisted features, and microservices on **AWS** with **Docker/Kubernetes** and CI/CD.
- Pragmatic by default: measure, iterate, automate, and keep the DX sharp.

## What I work with

**Frontend**
- React, Next.js, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- State/data: React Query, Zustand, Redux Toolkit
- Forms/testing: React Hook Form, Zod, Jest, Testing Library, Playwright

**Backend**
- Node.js (Express/Fastify/Nest), REST & GraphQL, tRPC
- Auth (JWT/OAuth/OpenID), WebSockets/Realtime
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Prisma, Redis

**Cloud & DevOps**

- Observability: OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Prometheus, Sentry

**Data & Messaging**
- ETL tooling, event-driven patterns, RabbitMQ/Kafka (when needed)

## Engineering values

- **Clarity first:** small PRs, strong naming, short RFCs when trade-offs matter.  
- **Instrumentation:** logs, metrics, traces before “it works on my machine.”  
- **Performance with purpose:** profile → fix → verify with budgets.  
- **Security by habit:** least privilege, secret hygiene, automated checks.  
- **Ownership:** product thinking, not just tickets.

---

## Recent focus

- Shipping AI-assisted product features (retrieval, structured outputs, evals).
- Hardening CI pipelines (type-safe migrations, preview envs, contract tests).
- Making UIs feel instant with smart caching, optimistic updates, and streaming.

---

## How to work with me

- Clear scope, aggressive tests, and a crisp rollout plan.  
- I love turning fuzzy requirements into something measurable and maintainable.

<!--
Tips:
- Keep this README outcome-focused: what you ship and how you work.
- Pin 3–6 repos that show breadth (frontend, backend, infra) and quality (tests, docs, benchmarks).
- Revisit quarterly: update “Recent focus” and “Selected work”.
